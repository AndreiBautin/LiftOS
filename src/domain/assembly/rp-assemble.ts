 *   2. **The week ramps into it.** Week one opens near MEV and climbs, so
 *      the block has somewhere to go.
 *   3. **Strength work is placed first** and its volume counted, because
 *      the competition lifts are not negotiable and they pay several
 *      muscles at once.
 *   4. **Hypertrophy fills the remainder**, cheapest-first by SFR, capped
 *      at MRV across the whole week rather than per session.
 *
 * Step 4's ordering is what a garage gym makes matter. With no cables,
 * the difference between filling side delts with lateral raises and
 * filling them with upright rows is most of the week's systemic budget.

 * itself clamped to what its tier's frequency can deliver. The target is
 * the recovery budget now, and the ceiling was a second one applied on
 * top: a day could satisfy every landmark it was accountable for and be
 * cut off mid-fill anyway.
 *
 * What it actually cost is worth writing down, because "a cap nobody
 * reaches" is how it read right up until the split changed. Two upper
 * days with nine tier-2 muscles ran out of clock at six accessory slots,
 * so the side delts and the triceps got one session where their tier
 * asked for two — a training decision made by a constant, invisible on
 * every screen, and unreachable by any setting.
 *
 * The day is now as long as the volume asked for, and nothing bounds it
 * except the arithmetic that produced the volume. That is not unbounded:
 * one exercise per muscle per session times five sets is the ceiling, and
 * the muscle list a day carries is fixed by the split. If a session comes
 * out too long the answer is fewer muscles at tier 2 or more days —
 * decisions a person makes and can see — rather than a number here
 * quietly declining to schedule the last two.

 * decided. It excluded two groups: isolations where failing degrades form
 * (lateral raises, shrugs, calf raises) and lifts where failing is
 * genuinely dangerous or expensive — a skullcrusher over your face, a
 * good morning under a loaded spine.
 *
 * The rep ranges above defuse the first group entirely and most of the
 * second: an isolation at 15–30 is a light implement and a long set, and
 * failing a thirty-rep French press is a different event from failing an
 * eight-rep one. What it does *not* defuse is a compound hinge at 5–8 —
 * a Romanian deadlift or a good morning taken to failure is a real risk,
 * and those are the slots to look at first if this turns out to have been
 * too broad.
 *
 * The strongest argument against it was not about safety at all, and it
 * is preserved here because it is the one that will still be true next
 * year. **Failure is not a clean event on every movement.** On a lateral
 * raise, a shrug, a calf raise or a hanging leg raise there is always
 * another rep if you cheat the form a little, so "to failure" resolves to
 * "until your technique goes" rather than to a definite point — and an
 * instruction that resolves differently every week is worse than one rep
 * in reserve every week. Dips and pull-ups are the contrast: you either
 * complete the rep or you do not, and the set ends itself.
 *
 * That was the reason most isolation work carried `safeToFail: false`,
