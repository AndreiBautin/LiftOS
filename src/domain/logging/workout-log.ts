 * repositories. LiftTracker generated `Set` rows into the database when a
 * program was created and then wrote actual reps and load into those same
 * rows — so the program *was* the log. Editing a program rewrote history;
 * a completed cycle could not be repeated; and planned-versus-actual
 * could not be compared, because only one of the two survived. StrengthFlow
 * collapsed them differently but just as thoroughly, keeping a single
 * `currentProgram` document and date-keyed workout documents with no link
 * between them.
 *
 * Here a workout log is its own record. It embeds what was asked for
 * alongside what was done, references the program by id, and is never
 * written back into the template.

 * one number the entire autoregulation loop depends on. Skipping is also
