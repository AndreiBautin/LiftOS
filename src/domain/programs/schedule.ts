/**
 * Which session a date holds, read off the calendar.
 *
 * **This replaced a cursor, and reverses a rule that stood since the
 * first commit.** The program used to be a queue: finishing or skipping a
 * session moved a stored position on by one, on the reasoning that two
 * predecessor apps keyed sessions to weekdays and "drifted permanently out
 * of step the first time a lifter missed a Tuesday". That was right while
 * a day was a slot in a generated week. It stopped being right when the
 * week became the lifter's own routine, written by weekday — Push A is a
 * Monday — at which point a missed Tuesday is simply a missed Tuesday,
 * and a queue that holds Pull A over until Wednesday is the drift.
 *
 * Asked for as _"the app knows what day it is and the workouts each map
 * to a day so we should use that rather than keeping a cursor"_. The
 * cursor was also the one record with no correct merge across devices —
 * it is what read Push A on a phone and Pull B on a desktop.
 *
 * **What is still stored is one date: the Monday the block began.** The
 * day comes from the weekday; the week of the block, and the cycle, come
 * from whole weeks since that Monday. It changes only when the lifter
 * says which week they are in, so two devices cannot disagree about it.
