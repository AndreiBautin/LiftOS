/**
 * Warm-up sets up to a working load.
 *
 * **The empty bar, then forty, sixty and eighty percent**, at falling
 * reps — ten, five, three, two. It is the ramp most strength coaches
 * write some version of, and the point of it is to rehearse the movement
 * at loads that cost nothing, not to add work: the reps fall as the bar
 * climbs so the last warm-up leaves the working sets fresh.
 *
 * **Every step is a load the plates can make.** Each is rounded down to
 * the nearest load the plates to hand load exactly, so a ramp on a home
 * set with no 2.5s never asks for 137.5. A step that rounds onto the one
 * before it, or up against the working load, is dropped rather than
 * repeated: two warm-ups at 135 is one warm-up written twice.
