/**
 * What an estimated max says you could lift for a given number of reps,
 * beside what you actually have.
 *
 * **The formula run backwards** — the same one the estimate came from, so
 * the 1RM row is the estimate and the rest follow from it — and rounded
 * down to a load that can be made. Beside each row, the heaviest bar ever
 * moved **in that row's bracket** — three or four reps for the triple row.
 * "At least that many" was tried and read badly: a set of five then
 * filled the single row at five-rep weight, under a prediction nobody had
 * attempted, and looked like a weakness. A row where the actual beats the
 * prediction is a rep range you are strong in, and one well below it is
 * the opposite. Past ten reps every formula drifts, which is why the
 * table stops at twelve.
