/**
 * The data the deployed app shows a first-time visitor.
 *
 * Three things make this safe to publish, and they are structural rather
 * than careful:
 *
 * 1. **Generated, never captured.** Every record below is written here,
 *    in a file anybody can read. There is no export step from a personal
 *    device anywhere in the pipeline, so there is no path by which real
 *    data could arrive.
 * 2. **A separate namespace.** A demo build sets `VITE_DEMO_MODE`, which
 *    moves the IndexedDB name and every storage key to a `lifeos.demo`
 *    prefix. The demo and any personal data on the same browser cannot
 *    collide.
 * 3. **Seeded only into empty storage.** `seedDemoData` refuses when
 *    anything is already there. That is a tested property rather than a
 *    convention — see `seed.test.ts`.
 *
 * **It drives the app's own use cases rather than writing records.**
 * Hand-built fixtures drift from the types they imitate and can encode
 * states the app cannot actually produce; going through `addProject` and
 * the rest means a fixture that compiles is a fixture the app could have
 * created, and every invariant those functions enforce holds here too.
 *
 * **Every date is an offset from the seed moment.** A fixture pinned to
 * absolute dates rots: opened a year later it shows dead streaks and an
 * empty "this month". Offsets keep it alive while staying deterministic
 * for a given clock.
