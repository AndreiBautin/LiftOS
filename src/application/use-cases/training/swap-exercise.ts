/**
 * Doing something else in the slot: the rack is taken, or a joint says
 * no to today's movement.
 *
 * **The log records what was done.** The entry is filed under the
 * exercise actually performed, with `substitutedFor` naming the one the
 * programme asked for — so the swapped exercise's own history grows, and
 * the programmed one's is not credited with a session it never had.
 *
 * **The weight comes from the swapped exercise's own history**, through
 * `planFromHistory`, the function Start uses: a dumbbell press is not a
 * barbell press at a discount, and guessing a ratio would be the app
 * inventing a number. With no history it opens with no weight, the same
 * as a first session of anything.
 *
 * **Sets already done stay where they were.** Swapping after two sets of
 * rows splits the entry: the rows keep their two, and the rest move to
 * the new exercise as a new entry beside it. Relabelling the logged sets
 * would file work under an exercise that never had it.
