 *
 * The split is not arbitrary. Settings are small, always read together,
 * and read synchronously at startup before anything can be rendered —
 * localStorage is genuinely the right tool for that shape. More
 * importantly, keeping them in a different store means a corrupted or
 * rebuilt IndexedDB does not take a lifter's training maxes and volume
 * landmarks with it. Losing your history is bad; losing your history
 * *and* every number needed to resume training is worse.
 *
 * Reading is total: a malformed value degrades to the default and reports
 * a warning rather than throwing at startup, because a settings blob that
 * cannot be parsed must not be able to prevent the app from opening.
