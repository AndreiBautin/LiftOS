/**
 * The composition root.
 *
 * The only file allowed to name a concrete implementation. Everything
 * else takes what it needs as a parameter, which is what makes a
 * use-case testable by handing it an in-memory double instead of a
 * database — and what neither old app had, where a Razor component
 * constructed its own `DbContext` and a React component called Firestore
 * directly.
 *
 * Notably short now. Bootstrap used to seed programs, additively sync
 * them, refresh the ones whose content had changed, retire the withdrawn
 * ones, re-snapshot an untrained run and auto-start the default — six
 * mechanisms whose combined job was keeping a *stored copy* of the
 * program in step with the code. The program is derived from settings
 * now, so none of them exist.
