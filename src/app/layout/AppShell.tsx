/**
 * The shell every screen sits inside, and it has no navigation.
 *
 * **One page, so nothing to navigate between.** Asked for as _"lets just
 * condense this into one page without a navbar"_, once the app had
 * narrowed to a workout tracker and its You, Train and History tabs were
 * three views of one workout log. There was a bottom bar on phones and a
 * collapsible rail from `lg` up; both went, with the sidebar's stored
 * collapsed state. Program and Settings are reached from links on the
 * page and carry their own way back.
 *
 * **The safe area is the shell's job, not each page's** — every screen
 * below is an ordinary block of content and none of them should have to
 * know a notch exists. The sides matter in landscape on a notched phone,
 * where the cutout eats into one edge.
 *
 * **No width cap from `lg` up.** `Masonry`'s `column-width` is a real CSS
 * minimum — the browser only adds a column once there is a full extra
 * column of room — so it, not a ceiling picked for one screen, is what
 * stops a column getting too narrow on a wide monitor.
