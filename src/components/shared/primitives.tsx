/**
 * A card that names itself, with its controls on the same line.
 *
 * The alternative is `Section`, which puts a large heading and a lit
 * accent rule *above* the card. That reads as a settings pane — a title
 * over a grey line is what a form looks like — and it is what the home
 * screen dropped when it was asked to stop breaking up the flow of the
 * cards. A game screen is cards; a card says what it is inside itself.
 *
 * **Used inside a card, or directly above a run of them.** Quests is the
 * second case: `ActiveQuests` and every `ProjectCard` draw their own
 * card, so a wrapper would be a card inside a card. The heading row is
 * the same either way, which is the point — the two screens should not
 * grow two different ideas of what a block title looks like.
 *
 * `Section` remains for the case it was written for: a heading that has
 * to carry a **description** as well, and read as a division of the page
 * rather than a label on a panel.
 *
 * The heading is deliberately `text-sm` and dim: it is a label on a
 * panel rather than the page's own title, and the largest thing on a
 * screen should be the thing you came to read.
 *
 * **The icon sits in a tinted badge, not bare.** A plain 16px glyph in
 * the same dim ink as the label read as an afterthought — every card on
 * the app opens with one, so a bare icon was really the first thing
 * every screen showed, and it looked like clip art. A small
 * accent-tinted square gives it the weight of a mark rather than a
 * decoration, the same "tint over the surface" recipe `.control-surface`
 * already uses for a button, at a scale that reads as a badge instead of
 * a control.
