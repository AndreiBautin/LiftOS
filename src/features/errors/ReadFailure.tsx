/**
 * A read that failed, said out loud.
 *
 * **The defect this exists for is that a failed read and a slow one look
 * identical.** Every card in this app renders a skeleton while
 * `data === undefined`, which is the right shape for loading and is also
 * exactly the state an *errored* query sits in — `retry: false` is a
 * deliberate default, so a query that throws resolves once, keeps
 * `data` undefined, and the screen waits forever.
 *
 * It presented as a hang rather than as a failure. The whole app came up
 * as placeholders on a device that had signed in perfectly well, and
 * nothing anywhere said why.
 *
 * **One banner rather than eighty-nine call sites**, and that is a
 * judgement rather than laziness. Teaching every card to distinguish
 * `isError` from loading is the thorough fix and touches every screen in
 * the app; what a person actually needs is to know that something failed
 * and to be able to try again, which is one component. The cards keep
 * their skeletons — a skeleton beside a banner saying a read failed is
 * no longer a lie.
 *
 * It is deliberately **not** a toast: this state persists until somebody
 * acts on it, where a toast is for something that has already finished
 * happening.
