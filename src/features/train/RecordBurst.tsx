/**
 * **A record set bursts once, the moment it is logged** — a ring of gold
 * sparks from the chip and a short buzz where the platform allows. The
 * chip already pops and shines; this is the one moment in a session
 * worth more than that, and it happens at most a few times a month.
 *
 * Only for a set logged in the last three seconds — the row turns on the
 * tap (`useLogSet`), so that is ample — and so opening a finished
 * session or paging back to an exercise does not set it off again. The
 * sparks are decoration (`aria-hidden`); the chip beside them carries the
 * words. Reduced motion collapses the animation with every other one.
