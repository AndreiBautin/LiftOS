/**
 * The whole app, on one page.
 *
 * **One page and no navigation bar.** Asked for as _"lets just condense
 * this into one page without a navbar"_, once the app's tabs had become
 * three views of one workout log. The next session, strength, the trend,
 * the training grid and the history read top to bottom; Program and
 * Settings are the only other screens, each a link from here with a way
 * back.
 *
 * **It opens on the hero**, which names the next session and starts it.
 * It was a portrait and a level while the app was a game, then a bare
 * "LiftOS" over a gear — and in both the session you came to start sat
 * a card's height down. See `HeroBanner`.
 *
 * **The takeover is the rule that survived every arrangement.** An
 * unfinished workout is the only thing that matters until it is
 * finished, and burying it behind a dashboard is how half-logged
 * sessions get lost — so while one is open this page *is* the session
 * player, and after finishing it is the report until dismissed. Starting
 * a session therefore needs no navigation: the active-workout query
 * refetches and the page swaps itself.
 *
 * **The cards are balanced by measured height, not assigned to columns.**
 * `Masonry` takes as many ~360px columns as the width holds and drops
 * each card into the shortest one; on a phone it is a single stack in
 * this order. The history is one of the cards: it ran full width
 * underneath on the reasoning that a list reads better wide, and on a
 * monitor that made it a stack of empty stripes.
